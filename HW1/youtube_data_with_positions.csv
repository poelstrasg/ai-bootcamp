weatherproof decks,5,Waterproofing a Plywood Roof Deck or Balcony with Liquid Rubber Deck Coating!,Abbotts At Home - DIY & Home,2020-06-08T18:37:31Z,"This Liquid Rubber Deck Coating is FANTASTIC, guys! It's easy to apply to Plywood Decks or Balcony's, looks and feels good, and it's very durable.

Hi guys! This video is a step by step look at using Liquid Rubber Deck Coating to waterproof the plywood deck or balcony over the play house I'm building. After applying 5 gallons of the liquid rubber (about 5 coats on this 75 sq foot area), the surface looks great and feels like soft linoleum under bare feet. And, it seems just as durable as linoleum.

I found Liquid Rubber Deck Coating after 2 days of research and reading product reviews. I have in no way been supplied material or paid for use of this product. If I ever decide that this product isn't working or holding up to normal wear and tear, I'll post the details here.

See how this Liquid Rubber has held up in this 2 years later look at this deck: https://youtu.be/iI3UmN2-Qe0

If there’s something that humans are very good at, it’s categorizing things - themselves, cats, colors, even Hogwarts houses. That’s because we’re adept at recognizing patterns, not just in how things look, but how they interact with one another. In Magic, we often see recurring themes and patterns in how certain decks play out, and how they interact not just with your opponent, but the board state as well.

We call these archetypes, because we see them come up in almost every format again and again like an old friend, or in some cases, an old nemesis. By labeling these different deck archetypes, we can understand what a deck is trying to do just by hearing the name of it.  If I say “Red Deck Wins”, you know this deck is focused on a Aggro strategy, has no Control elements, and uses cards like lightning bolt and goblin guide. It immediately tells you what the deck is trying to do, and how going about it. 

In this episode, we’ll be exploring the three primary types of deck archetypes we see in Magic: The Gathering: Aggro, Control and Combo. We’ll talk about their strengths, their weaknesses, and how to evaluate cards to build these archetypes in both Limited and Constructed.

Which of these archetypes should I play?

This depends on the format, and also on the timing. If you’re looking for a good win rate, the best time to play an Aggro strategy is usually right after a set comes out in Standard. Because the format is still being in some ways “figured out”, being proactive and focusing on just killing your opponent is an effective way of getting those early wins.

Once a format becomes more defined, it’s easier to build a Control deck to beat what other people are doing, which is usually at the end before the next set is released, or before rotation.  Combo is sprinkled throughout the lifespan of a format sometimes, when and if there is a good busted combo in a Control deck. If people are playing a lot of Aggro decks, then it’s a good time to do one of those Engine decks, as long as it’s fast and can kill by turn 5 if there isn’t interaction.

But honestly, the real answer to this question is: any of them you want! What is amazing about Magic: the Gathering as a game is its flexibility. You can express yourself through gameplay in almost any way you might wish. I love my Modern Merfolk deck, and no matter how it’s doing in the meta, I’ll continue to play it, regardless of what other people think. For you that might be your Cat tribal Standard deck, your Burn deck, or even 8 Rack. Whatever you choose, follow your bliss and fine tune it to the best of your ability. Different people play Magic differently, and in that lies the inherent beauty and freedom of the game.

deck diy ,4,💰Cheap DIY Floating Deck💰,The Neighbor Dominator,2021-03-28T13:00:06Z,"I built this deck from start to finish in this video.  I was quoted $5500 for a 14 foot floating deck!  I built this for a little over $800 in 5 and a half hours and I don't really own tools.  I learned from watching do it yourself youtube videos and this is proof you can build a cheap floating deck in a day too because I just did it in this video.  This is not necessarily a how to video but I explain what I am doing before every time lapse.  I hope this video helps you in some way.  If you have any questions leave a comment below or reach me on Instagram.  This is the first of many DIY projects I am doing so please SUBSCRIBE to the channel and hit the bell.  Our Instagram links are at the bottom. #deckbuild #floatingdeck #diydeck

Here is the one year update with all the materials and Q&A - https://youtu.be/b4no9WnGHmQ

But make sure to SUBSCRIBE to the channel for my giving back campaign this season.  I am going to be putting in the money I make from social media and speaking with all the companies I work with to help me give back to you guys because you have given me so much happiness by subscribing to my channel. My 2021 goals are...

1. Giveback as much as I can through products that I use.  Some people always want to try these high end products.  Well, I am going to give as much of it to you guys as I can.  Every video if possible so you can use what I am using.

2.  I want to save up enough Allett dollars and give away the same reel mower I use which is a Liberty 43.  It is a $2000 cylinder mower.  You have to use my promo code TND99 when their site starts accepting it.  It will give you $100 off any machine and put $100 in the donation fund. So for now if you are interested in buying one just reach out to Roland who is the King of US sales and deals directly with the UK and mention my name (Clint, TND99, The Neighbor Dominator).  His direct number is (803)226-5036.
 
My merch store is up and running with the basic stuff but it is high quality (not tee-spring garbage) and it is way cheaper.  Come buy a shirt, proceeds go to my daughter.
 Merch- https://www.theembroideryshoppe.com/on-line-catalog/the-neighbor-dominator.html

Also I have my amazon store up with all the products I use or have used with results including all equipment and camera gear I use too.  Come shop here and feed the family.
Amazon store- https://www.amazon.com/shop/theneighbordominator

The fertilizer company I stand by is Simple Lawn Solutions.  It is all I use on my front showcase lawn.  If you are considering using their products please go through my link.  It keeps track that I am doing a good job.
SLS Store- https://www.simplelawnsolutions.com/?rfsn=3782882.a8adc3

I'm working with Petra this year.  I will be going over all their products and will be giving some away in the future.  If you use coupon code TND10 you get 10% off a sprayer.  Here is the link to check out all their products.
Petra Sprayers- https://petratools.com/?ref=tnd

These are all my social media sites.  I mainly use Instagram and can be reached there.  I have my linktree here as well that has all of them in there but it sucks because you have to log into stuff.  I am in the process of making a website.  Hopefully by summer it will be done.

In today's video we answer all your questions about our recent composite deck build! Over the last 3 episodes, we have demolished our old deck, framed out our new deck, and installed new composite decking overtop of it. We are so happy with how it turned out!

We discuss the pros and cons of a composite deck compared to using pressure treated lumber for decking. We also include a cost breakdown of the project and compare how much more expensive composite decking is versus wood boards. We also discuss where we sourced all our material and what specific decking we went with. We show you our plans for the rest of the backyard and go over the next exciting project we have in store for you all!

Thank you for watching and hopefully you found the video helpful!
